# GitHub to OpenAI

This is a Tampermonkey userscript that adds a button that will copy the content of a GitHub issue/discussion/PR and akt to OpenAI GPT-3 what should be answered.

I found that the answers are most of the time quite relevant, just need some manual adjustments to make it fully human-like üí•

## How does it work?

1. Extract the whole conversation, including the pseudos
2. Indicate which pseudo is mine
3. Clearly separate each message so the AI understands the context properly
4. Ask to complete my next answer

As an example, this is what the prompt would look like (PR: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/23095):

```
This is a conversation on GitHub. My username is "rigwild".

@rigwild on [Nov 26, 2022, 3:11 AM GMT+1]: "Description

Previous PR added support for missing statistics #23074
This PR implements a proper parsing of all these statistics.

Support "short" format ts99
Support "long" format
TS(10%:90%) | TS(10:90)
TS(:90) | TS(:90%)

@rix0rrr on [Nov 30, 2022, 12:37 PM GMT+1]: "Hi @rigwild!

Heads up, that enum you modified in your previous PR was exposed by accident, and was never supposed to be public! ü´£

I've moved your new enum values to a class with factory functions in this PR here: #23172

Thanks for updating the parsing logic as well, but I'm unclear on whether this changes any output. Is it just for completeness of the internal typing?"

Your goal is to answer to this conversation with an appropriate response.

Response:

@rigwild:

```

And the OpenAI suggested answer:

```
Thanks @rix0rrr, that's a great suggestion! I'll try to use Annotations.of(construct).addWarning(...) when the metric is added to a Graph or Alarm. I'll update the PR once I'm done.
```

Most common issue I faced with this experiment: the maximum length of a prompt is 4097 tokens. On large issues/PRs, the amount of text can easily be way above that.
For now, it's good for not so difficult/long conversations.

## More complex example

I tried this with a browser feature proposal related to privacy - a quite complex/niche topic: [Privacy by design with browser-managed E2E encryption and Fenced Frames](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/31).

For this, I modified the prompt a bit:

```
"Your task: give a constructive and argumented critic on this proposal."
```

And the suggested response:

```
This proposal for adding privacy features to web browsers is an interesting idea and could be a great way to improve user privacy and security. However, there are a few areas of concern that must be addressed in order for this to be successful. 

First, there needs to be a clear way for web apps to opt-in to this feature. That way, web apps that are not compatible with the proposed architecture won't be forced to use it, and users will still be able to use those services. Additionally, the opt-in process needs to be user-friendly and secure, so that users understand the implications and can make an informed decision.

Second, there needs to be an easy way for users to access their data across different browsers, devices, and platforms. For instance, users should be able to access their data on their laptop, phone, and tablet, and they should also be able to access their data from different browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This is important because it allows users to have more control over their data and to be able to easily migrate to different browsers and devices.

Third, there needs to be a way for users to back up their data and to restore it in case of data loss. This is important because users should not be at risk of permanently losing their data due to a browser issue or a device issue. 
Finally, there needs to be a way for developers to build apps that use the proposed architecture without introducing any security or privacy issues. For example, developers should be able to use the proposed architecture to build authentication and password managers without introducing any security or privacy issues. Additionally, developers should be able to build apps that use the proposed architecture without introducing any performance issues. 

Overall, this is an interesting proposal that could have a positive impact on user privacy and security. However, it is important that all of the areas of concern mentioned above are addressed before this feature can be implemented. 
```

The results are very impressive. It understood the context and the requested proposal quite well! ü§Ø
